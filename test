# Curl, and most browsers, default to sending Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded for a POST.
# Get requests should not specify Content-type because they do not have a body.

# Curl defaults to Accept: */*, however each browser defaults to a different default value.
# Chrome defaults to Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8
# See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation/List_of_default_Accept_values
